            that hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent
            limitations. Unlike actual trading records, simulated results do not
            reflect real trading activities. Additionally, because simulated
            trades are not executed, results may over or undercompensate for
            certain market factors such as liquidity. Simulated trading programs
            are also designed with the benefit of hindsight, which may impact
            their accuracy. Sure Leverage makes no representation that any
            trading account will achieve similar profits or losses as those
